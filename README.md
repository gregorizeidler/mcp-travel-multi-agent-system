## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Error: [error message]"**: Check your internet connection and API keys
- Verify both OpenAI and Google Maps API keys are entered correctly
- Try again in a few minutes - the MCP servers may be temporarily unavailable

**Missing distance information**: Google Maps MCP connection issue
- Check your Google Maps API key validity
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions for Maps API
- Try refreshing the page and entering the keys again

**Slow response times**: MCP servers can take time to respond
- The app has a 60-second timeout configured
- Wait for the process to complete - detailed itineraries take time to generate

**Network/Firewall issues**: Some corporate networks may block MCP connections
- Try from a different network
- Use a VPN if necessary
- The app will show connection errors if MCP servers are unreachable

### API Key Issues
- **OpenAI API Key**: Make sure you have credits in your OpenAI account and the key is valid
- **Google Maps API Key**: Ensure the key has Maps API enabled and proper billing setup

### Tool Status
The app will show you which data sources were successfully used:
- 🏨 **"Your travel itinerary is ready with Airbnb data!"** = Airbnb MCP connected successfully
- 📝 **"Used general knowledge for accommodation suggestions"** = Airbnb MCP failed, using general knowledge as fallback

> **Note**: The app is designed to work reliably! Even if MCP connections fail, it will generate comprehensive itineraries using available tools and information.
